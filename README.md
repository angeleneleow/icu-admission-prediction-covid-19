# PREDICTING EARLY ICU ADMISSION BASED ON COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS OF PATIENTS IN BRAZIL.
> Sheetal Shajan, Angelene Leow

## BACKGROUND MOTIVATION
As the world continues to struggle to contain the ongoing novel virus that is COVID-19, the major obstacle faced by healthcare institutions is the unpredictability in demand for healthcare resources such as ventilators and ICU resources to treat critically ill patients. This obstacle can be mitigated if a machine learning model is able to predict correctly if a patient with covid-19 will be admitted to the ICU hours before it happens. For our project, we have chosen to look at the Covid-19 cases specifically from Hospitals Sírio-Libanês, São Paulo and Brasilia in Brazil.
